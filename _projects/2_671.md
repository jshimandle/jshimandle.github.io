## Experimental Analysis Soil as a Thermal Storage Medium	(Spring 2025)
* Studied effects of different soil properties on performance of soil-based thermal storage, as a potential low-cost medium for scalable off-grid energy storage.
* Collected >100 hours of data across 9 different soil mixtures, demonstrating significant positive relationship between thermal storage efficiency and soil water content and density.
