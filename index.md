# Welcome to My Portfolio

## Hey there, I'm Josiah.

I'm a final year mechanical engineering student at MIT pursuing a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering with a passion for turning engineering innovation into meaningful impact in the lives of those who need it most. I'm primarily interested in tackling issues of sustainability, conservation, and human development with practical engineering tools.

I am passionate about capturing the beauty in this world and telling its story through photography, music, and writing. I enjoy learning about the world through sunrise hikes, long walks, and life stories while getting lost in  people and places I meet along the way.

Check out my [projects page](/projects) to see some of the things I've worked on.
