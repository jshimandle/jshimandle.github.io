# Welcome to My Portfolio

I'm a final year mechanical engineering student at MIT pursuing a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering with a passion for turning engineering innovation into meaningful impact in the lives of those who need it most. I'm primarly interested in tackling issues of sustainability, conservation, and human development with practical engineering tools.
